<!-- <h3>Your text here</h3> -->
				<p>Listen to these real patients sum up Dr. Perez in their <a href="index.html">El Cerrito dental</a> reviews.</p>
<p>"Wow! You did a fantastic job on my son's front tooth. I can't even 
tell your <a href="dentistry/berkeley-dentist-bonding.html">bonding</a> is not his original tooth! Your bonding stands in a 
class by itself. 
</p>
<p>For me, I had years of problems with my front teeth until you fixed 
them. Now they look so natural and incredible. It was worth my son and I
 flying from San Diego to have you <a href="dentistry/berkeley-dental-implants.html">restore my front teeth</a> as well as 
his. 
</p>
<p>You are truly a miracle worker! Thank you so much."  <br />-<strong>Opre Wilson</strong> 
</p>
<p>"Dr. Mark Perez has the softest hands I have ever experienced in a dentist and his work is virtually pain-free."   <br />-<strong>Sheila Curtain</strong>
</p>
<p>"Thank you all for making coming to the dentist fun!!  Years of trauma and terror have been washed away!!"  <br />-<strong>Joe Vanderkooy</strong>
</p>
<p>"We have always been satisfied and impressed by his care and 
attention and the outcome of his work. He has always been gentle, 
friendly, and skillful; in other words, first rate!"  <br />-<strong>Kenneth and Harriet Landon, El Cerrito, California</strong> 
</p>
<p>"I have been a dental patient of Dr. Mark Perez for many years, ever 
since he assumed the practice of Bertram Chan. I appreciate the 
opportunity to express my views of Dr. Perez. He has been extremely 
professional in his work as a dentist and we have developed a warm 
friendship throughout the years. 
</p>
<p>A number of years ago I was diagnosed with a form of cancer on my 
upper lip. I underwent a period of radiation, which eliminated that 
ailment. During my dental appointments, Dr. Perez carefully examined the
 area to ensure that the problem was eliminated and did not re-occur. 
For that careful attention I was deeply grateful. 
</p>
<p>I have a great admiration for his professionalism and value our 
continued close friendship. I also admire his association with the UCLA 
Center for Esthetic Dentistry. He is a wonderful person and highly 
professional dentist."  <br />-<strong>Ernie D., Former Mayor of El Cerrito, California</strong> 
</p>
<p>"I have been Dr. Perez's patient for many years. Dr. Perez's special 
combination of high quality care and sense of compassion for his 
patients makes him stand out amongst his peers. In addition, Dr. Perez's
 staff always put me at ease and make my dental visits so pleasant."  <br />-Anne H. 
</p>
<p>"I have been a patient of Mark Perez DDS for over 25 years. I have 
found his personal concern and care for me as a person is reflected in 
his recommendations and professional care of my dental health problems."
  <br />-<strong>Washington Burns M.D.</strong> 
</p>
<p>"Dr. Mark Perez has been our family dentist for years. He is always 
highly professional, skilled, courteous and considerate. He has 
performed many procedures for me and my family, some of which are, 
besides routine dental care and cleaning, treating cavities, creating 
bridges and partial plates and also creating porcelain veneers for me. 
We wouldn't consider seeing any other dentist. Therefore, I have 
referred many people to his practice and will continue to do so in the 
future."  <br />-<strong>Vivian Coe, El Cerrito, California</strong> 
</p>
<p>"We have been patients of Dr. Perez for the past 15 years even though
 we live 25 miles from his office. We were impressed with the gentleness
 he has when working on our teeth. He has the hands of a lamb when he 
performs examinations and displays sensitivity to the care and needs of 
his patients. His examinations are thorough, using state of the art 
equipment and he stays current with dentistry procedures. He is 
professional, listens well, is not pushy and treats his patients like 
family."  <br />-<strong>Dennis and Barbara Bullis</strong> 
</p>
<p>"As I entered my 70's, I realized that time and wear had taken their 
toll only teeth. Many had become chipped, small cracks were appearing 
and wearing down toward the gums and staining was a problem. I also 
noticed that I was smiling less and less. In a conversation with my 
dentist, Dr. Perez, I learned that I could remedy the problems with a 
procedure called Bite Balancing. He explained thoroughly and completely 
what would be done to stabilize my teeth, correct the problems, and 
retain a healthy, natural appearance. 
</p>
<p>At first, I was hesitant because of the expense but as I plan to be 
around until I celebrate 100 years, I decided to take the plunge. I have
 NEVER regretted my decision to have the work done. Very little plaque 
now adheres to the surface of my teeth and I care for them as I always 
have with brushing and flossing. It restored my teeth to a natural and 
healthy appearance for life. I am happy to report that my smile has 
returned, relaxed and confident."  <br />-<strong>Barbara Carr</strong> 
</p>
<p>"My other dentists have been painful and very uncomfortable. Dr. Perez is gentle."  <br />-<strong>John Mortenson</strong> 
</p>
<p>"Dr. Mark Perez has been the dentist for my wife and I for more 
years, now, than I can remember. There are a number of reasons that we 
can recommend Dr. Perez as an outstanding dentist. 
</p>
<p>Dr. Perez is rare in terms of the gentleness with which he treats his
 patients. For example, from the very first visit to him, my wife&rsquo;s fear
 of dental treatment has been most remarkably addressed by Dr. Perez and
 my wife has told me, time and time again, how gentle he has been in his
 dental treatment to her. 
</p>
<p>I have had significant periodontal issues with my teeth for years, 
yet I too have experience a kind of uncommon gentleness on his part, and
 a corresponding and surprising lack of pain on my part when Dr. Perez 
has cleaned my teeth. 
</p>
<p>Additionally, in all of my visits over the many years that I have 
seen Dr. Perez, I have never seen him rush. Indeed, I find the gift of 
his serenity as a professional dentist to be quite amazing. 
Additionally, as one of Dr. Perez patients, I have continually 
experienced his total and undivided attention while he is treating me. 
One notices right away when a practitioner fully concentrates and 
constantly attempts to refine and perfect their art. I noticed this 
right way about Dr. Perez.  <br />-<strong>Norm C.</strong> 
</p>
<p>"He is genial and relaxed, but there is nothing casual about the way 
he concentrates on your dental care! I drive about an hour to see him 
because it would be hard to find another real artisan."</p>
<p>-<strong>Alan C.</strong></p>
