	<heading>Oral Face Lift</heading>
	<text><![CDATA[<p>Over the years, people commonly wear through the enamel on their teeth. As the enamel wears, the height of their teeth diminishes and likewise the height of their face diminishes. An oral/dental facelift restores teeth to their original height and many times results in finer lines, wrinkles and a more youthful looking face. Dr. Perez has 25 years of experience performing oral/dental facelifts... An extremely passionate part of his practice!
