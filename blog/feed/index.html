Bright, white, straight teeth can boost your self confidence, take years off your appearance, and open up new opportunities.</p>
<p>At the office of <a href="../../" target="_blank">Dr. Mark Perez</a>, creating healthy, gorgeous smiles is our passion! We want you to know, however, that we are just as dedicated to helping you preserve that stunning smile for a lifetime through preventive dentistry.</p>
<p>Our highly-trained and experienced staff are committed to helping you make your dental health a priority. Recent studies have linked gum disease to heart disease, clogged arteries, stroke and premature birth. So there has never been a better time to give precedence to your dental care.</p>
<p>Contact our office today to ask about scheduling an appointment for dental hygiene care. At this visit, you will have a comprehensive exam with Dr. Perez which includes screening for decay, gum disease and oral cancers. Our gentle hygiene staff will expertly clean your teeth, taking the opportunity to educate you on your specific oral health care needs. It is also an excellent opportunity for you to discuss all of your dental health questions with our caring team. Your visit will take place in a comforting, relaxed environment with spa-like amenities. We look forward to serving you!</p>
